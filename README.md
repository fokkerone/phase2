## To Get Started:
before this package hits npm itself starting as always using `npm i`. Plan is to make global package + local likewise gulp does it.  


## Project Naming
From now on I always name my project after famous old school NYC graffiti writers as lil convention.
### Phase2
As single hits gave way to piecing, Phase 2 emerged as the leading stylist of his day; perhaps more importantly, he handed out styles to hundreds of writers at the bench at 149th street, making the entire subway movement look better then it was.
